One idea for automatic pooling information for the NFT market is to create a decentralized platform that aggregates data from various sources and provides comprehensive analytics and insights for NFT investors, collectors, and enthusiasts. Here's how it could work:
Data Collection: The platform would automatically gather data from different NFT marketplaces, blockchain networks, social media platforms, and other relevant sources. This data collection process could include information such as NFT sales, transaction history, ownership records, artist profiles, community sentiment, and market trends.

Data Analysis: The platform would employ advanced analytics techniques and algorithms to process the collected data. It could analyze historical sales data to identify patterns and trends, evaluate the popularity and demand for specific types of NFTs, and assess the performance of different artists and collections.

Market Insights: Based on the analyzed data, the platform would generate valuable insights and reports. These insights could include recommendations on trending NFT collections or artists, information on upcoming releases or events, pricing trends, and potential investment opportunities. It could also provide data-driven metrics for evaluating the value and authenticity of NFTs, helping users make informed decisions.

User Customization: The platform should allow users to customize their preferences and receive personalized insights based on their interests. Users could set alerts for specific artists, collections, or price ranges, ensuring they stay informed about relevant updates and opportunities.

Community Engagement: The platform could facilitate community interaction by providing forums, discussion boards, or social features where NFT enthusiasts can connect, share insights, and collaborate. Users could also contribute their own data or insights, enriching the platform's knowledge base.

Trust and Security: Given the importance of security in the NFT market, the platform should prioritize the integrity and authenticity of the data it collects. Implementing blockchain technology or decentralized protocols could help ensure transparency, immutability, and trustworthiness of the aggregated information.

By providing an automated and consolidated source of information, analytics, and insights, such a platform would empower NFT market participants to make informed decisions, navigate the market more effectively, and discover new opportunities.
